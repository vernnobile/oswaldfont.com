<h3>Oswald is a Free and Open font family.</h3>
            <p>Oswald is a reworking of the classic 'Gothic' and 'Grotesque' type styles, historically most usually represented by the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century faces such as, 'News Gothic', 'Alternate Gothic', 'Franklyn Gothic', and many more.</p>
    <p>Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>The Oswald fonts are available from <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald">Google Fonts</a> and <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oswald">Font Squirrel</a> in a variety of weights and versions.</p>
    <p>Oswald is under active development. More weights and versions are in the pipeline, and improvements to the allready in-use fonts are regularly made.</p>
